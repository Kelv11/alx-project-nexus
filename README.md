## üìö Major Projects & What I Learned

### ‚úÖ `alx-listing-app` (Airbnb Clone)

- Setup with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript.
- Built property listing cards, dynamic routing, filtering UI, and detail pages.
- **Learned:** component reusability, props drilling, responsive grid layouts.

### ‚úÖ `alx-project-0x04` to `alx-project-0x06` (Counter App Variants)

- Implemented counters using:
  - `useState` for basic state management
  - `Context API` for shared state across components
  - `Redux Toolkit` for scalable state logic
- **Learned:** managing local vs. global state, Redux slices, reducer patterns.

### ‚úÖ `alx-project-0x07` to `alx-project-0x13` (AI Image Generator)

- Integrated GPT APIs to generate images based on user prompts.
- Used server actions, optimistic UI, and Tailwind animations.
- **Learned:** external API integration, user experience enhancement, loading states.

### ‚úÖ `alx-project-0x00` to `alx-project-0x03`

- Scaffolded multiple projects using TypeScript, ESLint, TailwindCSS.
- Developed modular layout and reusable components.
- **Learned:** frontend architecture, folder structure planning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented

| Challenge                  | Resolution                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ESLint/Prettier conflicts  | Unified configuration across `.eslintrc`, `prettier.config.js`           |
| Dynamic routing in Next.js | Used `[slug]` and `generateStaticParams()` for static generation         |
| API Integration            | Used `fetch()` + `useEffect()` for client-side and server-side rendering |
| Redux setup complexity     | Modularized slices and used Redux Toolkit with `configureStore()`        |
| Styling inconsistencies    | Applied Tailwind‚Äôs utility classes and mobile-first approach             |

## üíé Best Practices & Key Takeaways

- **Component First**: Build small, testable, reusable UI components.
- **State Smart**: Know when to use `useState`, Context, or Redux.
- **Write Clean Code**: Use linters, meaningful variable names, and organize logic into layers.
- **Design Responsively**: Think mobile-first and test across devices.
- **Collaborate Early**: Always integrate backend APIs with proper communication.
